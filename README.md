Python Quine Code that operates as specified in Sipser's Introduction to ToC book.

A outputs code of <B,T>
B uses <B,T> to get its own code, then figures out <A> from it
B combines these descriptions as <A,B,T> to get <SELF>, which is its own code
T can then go on to compute with <SELF>, such a printing it out or calculating its own length
